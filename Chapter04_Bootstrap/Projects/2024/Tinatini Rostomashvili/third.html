            <p class="card-text">Ever since Harry Potter had come home for the summer,
                the Dursleys had been so mean and hideous that all Harry wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry.
                But just as he’s packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange impish creature who says that if Harry returns to Hogwarts,
                disaster will strike.

            <p class="card-text">Harry Potter thinks he is an ordinary boy.
                He lives with his Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and cousin Dudley,
                who are mean to him and make him sleep in a cupboard under the stairs.
                (Dudley, however, has two bedrooms, one to sleep in and one for all his toys and games.)
                Then Harry starts receiving mysterious letters and his life is changed forever.
                He is whisked away by a beetle-eyed giant of a man and enrolled at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
                and
                Wizardry.
                The reason: Harry Potter is a wizard!

                Harry can't wait to get back to school after the summer holidays.
                (Who wouldn't if they lived with the horrible Dursleys?) But when Harry gets to Hogwarts,
                the atmosphere is tense. There's an escaped mass murderer on the loose,
                and the sinister prison guards of Azkaban have been called in to guard the school...
